### üåÄ ATLANTIC BASIN FORECAST

**CURRENT THREAT ASSESSMENT:**
- **Threat Level:** üü¢ LOW (3.0/10)
- **Active Systems:** 0 detected
- **Analysis Confidence:** Medium

**FORECAST SUMMARY:**
Current Atlantic basin conditions analyzed using our proprietary **MCC Algorithm** indicate developing conditions that warrant continued surveillance. Environmental factors and historical patterns suggest low probability of significant development.

**DEVELOPMENT PROBABILITIES:**
- **Next 24 hours:** 30%
- **Next 48 hours:** 39%
- **Confidence Level:** High

### üåä EASTERN PACIFIC BASIN FORECAST

**CURRENT THREAT ASSESSMENT:**
- **Threat Level:** üü¢ LOW (3.0/10)
- **Active Systems:** 0 detected

**CALIFORNIA IMPACT ASSESSMENT:**
- **Current Risk Level:** LOW
- **Impact Probability:** Minimal
- **Development Outlook:** 10-20%

**SEASONAL CONTEXT:**
Peak Eastern Pacific activity typically occurs August through October. Current analysis suggests typical activity levels for mid-season period.

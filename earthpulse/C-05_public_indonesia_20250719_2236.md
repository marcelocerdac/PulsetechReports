**EARTHPULSE PROACTIVE ANALYSIS & PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT**
**Advanced Seismic Intelligence | 2025-07-19 22:36 UTC**

**🌍 SUNDA TRENCH ZONE**
**CURRENT SEISMIC ASSESSMENT:**
* **Activity Level:** 🔴 HIGH (8.5/10)
* **Active Patterns:** Monitoring in progress
* **Analysis Confidence:** High

**FORECAST SUMMARY:** Current Sunda Trench Zone conditions analyzed using our proprietary **MCC Algorithm** indicate seismic patterns that warrant continued surveillance. Environmental factors and historical patterns suggest variable probability of significant seismic activity.

**EVENT PROBABILITIES:**
* **Next 24 hours:** 0% M6.0+ | 0% M7.0+
* **Next 72 hours:** 0% M6.0+ | 0% M7.0+
* **Confidence Level:** High

**🌍 INDONESIA REGION CONTEXT:**
* **Current Risk Level:** Variable based on analysis
* **Monitoring Status:** Continuous surveillance active
* **Regional Outlook:** Based on 306 recent events

**SEASONAL CONTEXT:** Peak seismic activity patterns vary by region. Current analysis suggests monitoring levels appropriate for regional tectonic characteristics.

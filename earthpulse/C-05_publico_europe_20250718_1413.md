## 📅 Analysis Period

### Processed Data:
- *Temporal window analyzed:* 17 Jul 12:50 a 18 Jul 12:50 UTC
- *Comparison baseline:* Last 90 días of historical activity
- *Seismic events detected:* N/A
- *Stations monitored:* 25 regional seismic stations
- *Update frequency:* Every 15 minutos

### How was this data obtained?
To generate this assessment, our system processed and analyzed:

1. *Real-time seismic data* from recent hours
2. *Historical pattern comparison* from the last 90 días
3. *Statistical analysis* of normal vs. current activity in the region
4. *Integration of multiple* international seismic sources

### 📊 Official Data Sources:
- *USGS* (United States Geological Survey) - Earthquake Hazards Program
- *EMSC* (European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre) - Real-time Feed
- *Regional seismic networks* specific to each monitored zone
- *Historical databases* validated internationally

The assessment is based on the *relative behavior* of seismic activity, 
comparing current patterns with the characteristic historical record of this specific zone.

## üéØ Current Assessment

**STATUS: SIGNIFICANT ANOMALY DETECTED**

### Current Observation
Seismic activity in the Japan Subduction Zone is currently 82% below normal levels. This represents an unusual quiet period in regional earthquake activity.

### What This Means
This type of seismic quietness is a natural part of earthquake patterns and is being closely monitored

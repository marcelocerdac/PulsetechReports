## HIGH PRIORITY ZONES
**Primary Risk Areas:**
- **Italy**: Central and Southern regions, Sicily  
- **Greece**: Mainland and island regions
- **Turkey**: Western coastal areas
- **Balkans**: Albania, Montenegro, Croatia coastal zones
- **North Africa**: Algeria, Tunisia coastal regions

**Geographic Coverage:** 500km radius analysis zone spanning entire Mediterranean basin

### EARTHQUAKE PROBABILITY FORECAST

| Time Window | Moderate (M4.0-4.9) | Significant (M5.0-5.4) | Major (M5.5+) | Maximum Expected |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Next 24 hours** | **26%** | **10%** | **3%** | **M4.7+** |
| **Next 72 hours** | **41%** | **15%** | **5%** | **M5.0+** |
| **Next 7 days** | **45%** | **22%** | **7%** | **M5.2+** |

### PEAK RISK WINDOWS
- **Immediate (0-24h)**: Elevated risk for M4+ events
- **Short-term (24-72h)**: HIGHEST probability period for M5+ activity
- **Extended (3-7 days)**: Sustained elevated risk, potential M5+ events

## CURRENT ACTIVITY ASSESSMENT

### Unprecedented Activity Level
The Mediterranean region is experiencing **extraordinary seismic activity** at **10 times the normal rate**:
- **Normal baseline**: 3.2 earthquakes per day
- **Current activity**: 30+ earthquakes per day
- **Crisis duration**: 2-4+ weeks sustained

### Recent Significant Events
- **Maximum detected**: M5.2 earthquake within past 14 days
- **Recent maximum**: M4.7 earthquake within past 7 days  
- **Event characteristics**: Shallow depth (14-15km average) = higher impact potential
- **Pattern analysis**: Crisis has stabilized at extreme level (not exponentially escalating)

### Geographic Distribution
- **Region-wide activity**: Crisis spans entire Mediterranean basin
- **Not localized**: Multiple fault systems simultaneously active
- **Tectonic complexity**: Plate intersection environment with variable patterns
- **Historical context**: Unprecedented sustained activity for region

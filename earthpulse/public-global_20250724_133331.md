## üî¨ TECHNICAL METHODOLOGY

**EarthPulse Proprietary Algorithm** represents advanced seismic analysis technology that correlates machine learning pattern recognition with regional tectonic complexity. Our system processes continuous data streams from global monitoring networks.

**Data Quality Assurance:**
- **Source Validation:** Data sourced from USGS (United States Geological Survey) and EMSC (European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre)
- **Pattern Validation:** ML consolidation rates verified against known geological complexity metrics
- **Temporal Consistency:** Rolling analysis windows ensure temporal stability in probability assessments
- **Network Coverage:** Analysis weighted by seismic station density and regional monitoring capability

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

This experimental analysis is generated for scientific and educational purposes only. **This is not an official earthquake warning or alert.** All emergency planning and safety decisions should be based exclusively on official guidance from national seismological agencies and local emergency management authorities.

Earthquake forecasting involves inherent uncertainty. Our probabilistic assessments are experimental and should be used only as complementary information to official sources. Always follow local emergency protocols and official seismological guidance for safety decisions.
